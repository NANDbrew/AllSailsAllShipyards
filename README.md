# All Sails at All Shipyards

Enables the purchase and installation of any sail at any shipyard. Sails are no longer region-locked!

## Installation

Install Unity Mod Manager according to that program's instructions. Unzip the AllSailsAllShipyards.zip file in the "Mods" folder created by UMM in your Sailwind install directory. The filepath for the .dll and .json should be "...\Sailwind\Mods\AllSailsAllShipyards\[files]".

## Roadmap

- [x] Override shipyard selection with all sails
- [x] Add page buttons so all sails are viewable
- [ ] Customization of unlock requirements (e.g. require minimum reputation)
